                    <p>There are often peaks and lulls in workflow; that’s the nature of the industry. On the one hand, when you win new contracts it can be expensive, stressful, and time-consuming to recruit and onboard skilled full-time people. On the other, it’s costly and worrying to have underutilised staff sitting “on the bench” during quieter periods. And when they’re not engaged, there’s always a risk that team members will look at other employment options.</p>
