                    <p>There are often peaks and lulls in workflow; that’s the nature of the industry. On the one hand, when you win new contracts it can be expensive, stressful, and time-consuming to recruit and onboard skilled full-time people. On the other, it’s costly and worrying to have underutilised staff sitting “on the bench” during quieter periods. And when they’re not engaged, there’s always a risk that team members will look at other employment options.</p>

            <p>SkillSwap is all about making your business more competitive. Hire skilled people on non-
permanent contracts when you need to ramp up for a new piece of business. Protect
revenue by temporarily contracting out your IT workers to other businesses in the NEXTGEN
network during business cycle lulls. And do it all without recruitment fees, on-boarding
hassles, or full-time commitments.</p>
            <p>Using SkillSwap, the company requiring temporary skills pays an agreed rate to the
company providing their underutilised staff member(s). It’s quick to sign up, set up a profile,
and start using SkillSwap to hire and share resources right away.</p>
